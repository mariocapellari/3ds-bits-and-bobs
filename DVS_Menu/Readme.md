One way to create a custom pulldown menu in 3ds Max.

Users must use Shotgun Desktop to launch 3ds Max as it contains the necessary command line option to load the MAXScript file

1. 3ds Max needs to be launched with -U command line option pointing to included MAXScript file (see [Shotgun Software Configuration](https://dvs.shotgunstudio.com/page/4593) for examples 
2. MAXScript file will call our python code (example on how to build the pulldown menu "DVS" included)
